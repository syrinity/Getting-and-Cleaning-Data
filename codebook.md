###	Additional information about the variables from the original data 
			The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals 
		tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a 
		constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass 
		Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal 
		was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using 
		another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

			Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
		signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals 
		were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, 
		tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

			Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
		fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to 
		indicate frequency domain signals). 

		These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
		'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

		tBodyAcc-XYZ
		tGravityAcc-XYZ
		tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
		tBodyGyro-XYZ
		tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
		tBodyAccMag
		tGravityAccMag
		tBodyAccJerkMag
		tBodyGyroMag
		tBodyGyroJerkMag
		fBodyAcc-XYZ
		fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
		fBodyGyro-XYZ
		fBodyAccMag
		fBodyAccJerkMag
		fBodyGyroMag
		fBodyGyroJerkMag

		The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

		mean(): Mean value
		std(): Standard deviation
		mad(): Median absolute deviation 
		max(): Largest value in array
		min(): Smallest value in array
		sma(): Signal magnitude area
		energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
		iqr(): Interquartile range 
		entropy(): Signal entropy
		arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
		correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
		maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
		meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
		skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
		kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
		bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
		angle(): Angle between to vectors.

		Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

		gravityMean
		tBodyAccMean
		tBodyAccJerkMean
		tBodyGyroMean
		tBodyGyroJerkMean
